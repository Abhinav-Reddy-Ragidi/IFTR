# Team-32
This is the project we have developed as part of the JPMC Hackathon.
This project focuses on providing the digital solution for the collection of soil data and generating reports for the farmer in their native language.
It also generates the weather alerts for the farmers based on the weather conditons by fecthing from weather api and then based on those conditions if the farmer needs to be intimated 
then a whatsapp message will be sent to them in there native language and monitoring the weather and sending the weather alerts will be done twice a day.

<h2>Features of this project</h2>
<h5>Data synchronization :</h5> so Farmers as they are staying in the hilly areas wont be having the signals so if they enter data at such time then the data will be stored in browser cache memory and
  when they are connected to internet then that would be sent to the organization server.
<h5>Soil Reports :</h5> We send the soil reports to the farmers in the format of text message in whatsapp.
